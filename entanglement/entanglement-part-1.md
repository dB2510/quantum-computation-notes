* To understand the mathematics of entanglement, we need to introduce one more idea from linear algebra: *the tensor product*.
* We look at two systems with no interaction between them. Since there is no interaction, we could study each system by itself.
* But we can combine the two systems using tensor products. Most of the vector spaces in the *tensor product* represent what are referred to as *entangled states*.
* We start our analysis by taking two qubits: Alice has one, and Bob has another. We begin by examining a case where there is no interaction between Alice’s and Bob’s systems.
* It becomes fairly straightforward to extend the underlying ideas to the general entangled case.
* We suppose that Alice is measuring using the orthonormal basis (|a0>, |a1>) and Bob is measuring with orthonormal basis (|b0>, |b1>). A typical qubit for Alice is |v> = c0|a0> + c1|a1>, and for Bob is |w> = d0|b0> + d1|b1>.
