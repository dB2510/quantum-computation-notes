> Introduction to Bell:
* John Stewart Bell was an Irish physicist.
* He devised an ingenious test that could distinguish between the two models. 
* Many were surprised that the models were not just philosophies, but testable theories.
* His test has been carried out several times. It is tricky to eliminate all possible biases in the setup of this experiment, but more and more possible loopholes have been
excluded.
* The results have always been in accordance with the Copenhagen interpretation. Since Bellâ€™s result is one of the most important of the twentieth century and we have the mathematical machinery lined up, it makes sense to look at it!!
